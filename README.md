This is a website project from Team Treehouse. Here I've created a single page site practicing many of the fundamentals of CSS. I've created multiple versions of this site, but here is the simplest version. In other versions of this site, I've used flexbox to style a lot of the responsiveness of the website, but in this version, I used floats and clearfixes to style my site. 

This was great practice for me, and taught me a lot, not just about all of the available styling properties, and CSS selectors, but more importantly, how to use them to create an attractive layout, and learning design principles to help create these layouts in an appealing way.
